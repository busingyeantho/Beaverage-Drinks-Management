## ðŸ“‹ What Recipients Need to Do

### 1. **Clone/Copy the Project**
- Get the project files (all except the `.env` file)
- The `.env` file should NOT be shared (contains sensitive credentials)

### 2. **Set Up Google Cloud Project**
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project
3. Enable Google Sheets API:
   - Go to "APIs & Services" > "Library"
   - Search for "Google Sheets API"
   - Click "Enable"

### 3. **Create Service Account**
1. Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
2. Click "Create Credentials" > "Service Account"
3. Fill in details and create
4. Generate a JSON key file
5. Download the JSON file

### 4. **Create Google Sheets Document**
1. Create a new Google Sheets document
2. Create 3 sheets with these exact names:
   - **"LOADINGS"** - for morning loading data
   - **"RETURNS"** - for evening return data
   - **"SALES"** - for calculated sales (optional, can be auto-generated)

### 5. **Share Google Sheets**
1. Click "Share" in your Google Sheets
2. Add your service account email (from the JSON file) with "Editor" permissions
3. Copy the Spreadsheet ID from the URL

### 6. **Create .env File**
Create a `.env` file in the project root with:

```env
# Google Sheets API Configuration
GOOGLE_SHEETS_SPREADSHEET_ID=your_spreadsheet_id_here
GOOGLE_SHEETS_CLIENT_EMAIL=your_service_account_email@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com
GOOGLE_SHEETS_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nYour private key content here\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"

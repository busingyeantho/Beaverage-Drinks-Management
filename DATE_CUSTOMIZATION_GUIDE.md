# ðŸ“… Date Customization Guide

## Can I enter data for past dates?

**Yes!** You can absolutely enter data for any date, including past dates when you didn't have internet access.

## How to customize the date:

### 1. **Morning Loadings Screen:**
- Go to the "Morning Loadings" screen
- Tap on the "Add Loading" tab
- You'll see a date picker field labeled "Loading Date"
- Tap on the date field to open a calendar
- Select any date you want (past, present, or future)
- The selected date will be displayed prominently below the picker

### 2. **Evening Returns Screen:**
- Go to the "Evening Returns" screen  
- Tap on the "Add Returns" tab
- You'll see a date picker field labeled "Return Date"
- Tap on the date field to open a calendar
- Select any date you want (past, present, or future)
- The selected date will be displayed prominently below the picker

## Example Scenario:

**Yesterday (no internet):**
- You loaded products but couldn't record it
- Today you have internet
- Go to "Morning Loadings" â†’ "Add Loading"
- Change the date to yesterday
- Fill in the driver, vehicle, and product details
- Submit the form

**Result:** The data will be saved with yesterday's date, not today's date.

## Important Notes:

âœ… **Date Range:** You can select any date from year 2000 to 2100

âœ… **Sales Calculations:** The sales screen will correctly calculate sales based on the actual dates you select

âœ… **Data Integrity:** Each record maintains its own date, so you can have multiple entries for the same date

âœ… **No Timestamp Issues:** The date you select is the date that gets saved, regardless of when you actually submit the form

## Visual Indicators:

- **Blue box** shows the currently selected date for loadings
- **Orange box** shows the currently selected date for returns
- The date is displayed in a user-friendly format (e.g., "Monday, January 15, 2024")

## Tips:

1. **For missed days:** Simply select the date when the loading/return actually happened
2. **For future planning:** You can even enter data for future dates if needed
3. **Multiple entries per day:** You can have multiple loading/return records for the same date
4. **Date verification:** Always check the displayed date before submitting to ensure it's correct

This feature ensures that your data accurately reflects when events actually occurred, not when they were recorded in the system.
